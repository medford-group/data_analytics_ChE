# Exploratory Data Analysis

When working with large and high-dimensional datasets it can be difficult to get insight into the data. There are a range of techniques and algorithms that can assist in this process, many of which are classified as "unsupervised" data analysis algorithms (the data has features/inputs but no labeled outputs). This module will explore a few of these approaches and show how they can be used to visualize and analyze complex datasets.
